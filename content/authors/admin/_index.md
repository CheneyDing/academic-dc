I am a Ph.D. candidate at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I am part of the Parallel Data Storage Lab (PDSL) at Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, advised by [Prof. Jiguang Wan](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/wanjiguang/en/index.htm). My current research focus is on designing and optimizing storage systems for emerging data-centric architecture.
