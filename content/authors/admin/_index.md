I'm a second year PhD student of computer architecture at the WNLO. My research interests include distributed systems, storage systems and database. I'm currently researching how to optimize distributed storage systems with emerging heterogeneous hardware, such as DPU, IPU. Also, I'm interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and computer systems.
